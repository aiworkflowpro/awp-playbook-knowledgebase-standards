# Knowledge Base Management Standard

> Governs how to organize the knowledge base itself: directory structure, file naming conventions, and how to write content in each domain.
> Does not govern how things are created within it: code development, Agent construction, and content production each have their own standards.
> Before creating a new directory, creating a new file, batch renaming, or writing materials for a domain, start here to locate the relevant standard.

## Scope of Coverage

| Covered | Not Covered |
|---------|-------------|
| Organization rules for all directories and files in the knowledge base | Code development (covered by a separate development standard) |
| Cross-directory naming systems and document identity standards | Agent construction (covered by a separate Agent standard) |
| Directory structure skeletons for each area | Content writing methodology (covered by a separate content standard) |
| How materials should be written in each domain (methodology) | Markdown formatting and layout (covered by a separate document formatting standard) |
| Mapping and sync boundaries between two knowledge bases | Objective facts about publishing platforms (covered by a separate platform standard) |

## Three Dimensions

```text
naming/        What to name a file, what identity to give it     → Uniform across entire library, no exceptions
directory/     Where to place files, how to structure directories  → Select mode first, then build areas
methodology/   What to write in this directory, how to write it    → Divided by domain
```

The relationship between the three is **determine location first, then name, then content**:

1. Creating a new area: read `directory/kb-directory-pattern-registry.md` to select organization mode, read `directory/kb-directory-decision-composition.md` to confirm compatibility.
2. Area determined: read `naming/kb-naming-segment-convention.md` to name files, read `naming/kb-file-structure-metadata.md` to add metadata.
3. Writing content: read the corresponding domain volume in `methodology/`.

## Coverage Matrix

**Library-wide common standards** — apply to every directory and file:

| Layer | Documents |
|------|-----------|
| Naming and Identity | All 4 documents in `naming/` |
| Directory Organization | `directory/kb-directory-pattern-registry.md`, `directory/kb-directory-decision-composition.md` |
| Index Files | All 4 `directory/kb-entry-*.md` documents |
| Cross-Library Mapping | `directory/kb-vault-architecture-mapping.md` |

**Layer by area** — on top of common layer, each area receives additional constraints:

| Area | Directory Skeleton | Domain Methodology |
|------|-----------------|------------------|
| `{owner_root}` Owner | `kb-area-owner-skeleton` | — |
| `{brand_root}` Brand | `kb-area-brand-skeleton` | `methodology/brand/` 7 documents |
| `{commerce_root}` Commerce | `kb-area-commerce-skeleton` | `methodology/commerce/` 2 documents |
| `{workflows_root}` Workflow | `kb-area-workflows-skeleton` | — |
| `{tools_root}` Tools | `kb-area-tools-skeleton` | `methodology/tools/` 2 documents |
| `{business_root}` Business | `kb-area-business-skeleton` | `methodology/business/` 12 documents |

| `{personal_root}` Personal | `kb-area-personal-skeleton` | `methodology/personal/` 3 documents |

Areas without listed domain methodology are subject only to the common layer and their own directory skeleton. Content writing methodology for those areas is managed by other standards — workflows by the Agent Workflow Authoring standard, standard packages themselves by the Standard Authoring standard.

## Superseded Standards

Sixteen earlier standard packages were merged into this one. Their package IDs are retired and their source directories are archived. This table records what each retired package covered and where that content lives now, so an old reference can still be resolved.

| Retired Package Subject | Merged Into |
|----------------------|------------|
| Naming systems and directory organization | All of `naming/` + `directory/kb-directory-*` |
| Dual knowledge base mapping | `directory/kb-vault-architecture-mapping` |
| Index file authoring and area skeletons | `directory/kb-entry-*` + `directory/kb-area-*-skeleton` |
| Brand modeling | `methodology/brand/` (all 6 except persona) |
| AI persona modeling | `methodology/brand/kb-method-brand-persona.md` |
| Commerce direction scanning | `methodology/commerce/` |
| Business asset writing | `methodology/business/` |
| Research materials and interpretation | `methodology/research/` (all 3 except theory) |
| Theory-to-practice chain | `methodology/research/kb-method-research-theory.md` |
| Role protocol and channel operations | `methodology/operations/kb-method-dashboard-*` |
| Engagement strategy | `methodology/operations/kb-method-engagement-strategy.md` |
