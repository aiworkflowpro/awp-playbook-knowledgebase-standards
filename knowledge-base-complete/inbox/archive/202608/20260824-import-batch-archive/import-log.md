# Import Batch Log — 2026-08-24

> One record per document in the step 7 import batch. The four originals in this folder keep their

> back to where it came from.

## Records

### 1 · about-me-draft.md

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source file | `inbox/about-me-draft.md` |
| Mode | Extract |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Target path | `owner/profile.md`, `owner/decisions.md` |
| Operation summary | Merged the software engineering starting point and the "show, don't just build" motive into the profile; merged the fast-decision and weekly-publishing habit into decisions. |
| Processed at | 2026-08-24T20:10:00+08:00 |
| Confirmation | Per-document |

### 2 · competitor-notes-aug-2026.md

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source file | `inbox/competitor-notes-aug-2026.md` |
| Mode | Place |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Target path | `research/topics/competitor-channels/materials/202608/20260824-note-en-competitor-channels.md` |
| Operation summary | Dated competitor snapshot with subscriber counts — standalone reference value, so it was placed whole into a new research topic rather than broken up. Opened the topic `competitor-channels/` and registered it in `research/CLAUDE.md`. |
| Processed at | 2026-08-24T20:25:00+08:00 |
| Confirmation | Per-document |

### 3 · my-first-blog-post.md

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source file | `inbox/my-first-blog-post.md` |
| Mode | Place |
| Confidence | MEDIUM |
| Target path | `business/x/post-lessons-x-20260824.md` |
| Operation summary | A complete, publishable piece — placed as-is with frontmatter added. Five numbered lessons map onto the X thread format, which is the arena that fits; the knowledge base has no newsletter arena. |
| Processed at | 2026-08-24T20:40:00+08:00 |
| Confirmation | Per-document |

### 4 · old-naming-rules.md

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source file | `inbox/old-naming-rules.md` |
| Mode | Extract |
| Confidence | HIGH |
| Target path | `standards/naming-convention.md` |
| Operation summary | Only the 60-character filename cap was new. Lowercase, hyphens between words, and compact `YYYYMMDD` dates were already in the rule, so they were not written again. |
| Processed at | 2026-08-24T20:55:00+08:00 |
| Confirmation | Per-document |

## Batch Summary

```text
Batch processed: 4 documents
  Placed: 2 (research/ 1, business/ 1)
  Extracted: 2 (owner/profile.md, owner/decisions.md, standards/naming-convention.md updated)
  Skipped: 1 (inbox/20260824-video-script-youtube.md — not part of this batch)
Archive location: inbox/archive/202608/20260824-import-batch-archive/
```

`inbox/20260824-video-script-youtube.md` is the leftover file from the step 4 naming demo, not import
material. It stays in `inbox/` and is not archived here.

## Decisions Worth Recording

**The draft contradicted the profile, and the profile won.** `about-me-draft.md` calls Leo a software
engineer; `owner/profile.md` calls him a product manager. The profile came from Leo's own answers in
step 2, and `brand/audience.md` and `business/` are built on top of it — overwriting it would have
broken three areas. So the profile stayed authoritative, and the draft's claim was absorbed into it as
career order: software engineering first, then product management, then content creation. Both
statements are now true of the same person, and nothing in the knowledge base contradicts anything
else. Extract mode is not a paste — when the source disagrees with the target, decide which one the
rest of the knowledge base depends on, then reconcile in writing.
